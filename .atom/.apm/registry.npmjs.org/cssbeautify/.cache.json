For the\ncommand-line use, install Node.js [cssbeautify](https://npmjs.org/package/cssbeautify) package.\n\nFor more examples, see also its [test suite](http://cssbeautify.com/test/).\n\n## Using cssbeautify() function ##\n\nSince CSS Beautify is written in pure JavaScript, it can run anywhere that JavaScript can run.\n\nThe API is very simple:\n\n```javascript\nvar result = cssbeautify(style, options);\n```\n\n**options** is an optional object to adjust the formatting. Known options so far are:\n\n  *  <code>indent</code> is a string used for the indentation of the declaration (default is 4 spaces)\n  *  <code>openbrace</code> defines the placement of open curly brace, either *end-of-line* (default) or *separate-line*.\n  *  <code>autosemicolon</code> always inserts a semicolon after the last ruleset (default is *false*)\n\nExample call:\n\n```javascript\nvar beautified = cssbeautify('menu{opacity:.7}', {\n    indent: '  ',\n    openbrace: 'separate-line',\n    autosemicolon: true\n});\n```\n\n## Contributing ##\n\nContributions are welcomed!
