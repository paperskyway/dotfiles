    /**
     * FileSystem is a model object representing a complete file system. This object creates
     * and manages File and Directory instances, dispatches events when the file system changes,
     * and provides methods for showing 'open' and 'save' dialogs.
     *
     * The FileSystem must be initialized very early during application startup.
     *
     * There are three ways to get File or Directory instances:
     *    * Use FileSystem.resolve() to convert a path to a File/Directory object. This will only
     *      succeed if the file/directory already exists.
     *    * Use FileSystem.getFileForPath()/FileSystem.getDirectoryForPath() if you know the
     *      file/directory already exists, or if you want to create a new entry.
     *    * Use Directory.getContents() to return all entries for the specified Directory.
     *
     * FileSystem dispatches the following events:
     *    change - Sent whenever there is a change in the file system. The handler
     *          is passed one argument -- entry. This argument can be...
     *          *  a File - the contents of the file have changed, and should be reloaded.
     *          *  a Directory - an immediate child of the directory has been added, removed,
     *             or renamed/moved. Not triggered for "grandchildren".
     *          *  null - a 'wholesale' change happened, and you should assume everything may
     *             have changed.
     *          For changes made externally, there may be a significant delay before a "change" event
     *          is dispatched.
     *    rename - Sent whenever a File or Directory is renamed. All affected File and Directory
     *          objects have been updated to reflect the new path by the time this event is dispatched.
     *          This event should be used to trigger any UI updates that may need to occur when a path
     *          has changed.
     *
     * FileSystem may perform caching. But it guarantees:
     *    * File contents & metadata - reads are guaranteed to be up to date (cached data is not used
     *      without first veryifying it is up to date).
     *    * Directory structure / file listing - reads may return cached data immediately, which may not
     *      reflect external changes made recently. (However, changes made via FileSystem itself are always
     *      reflected immediately, as soon as the change operation's callback signals success).
     *
     * The FileSystem doesn't directly read or write contents--this work is done by a low-level
     * implementation object. This allows client code to use the FileSystem API without having to
     * worry about the underlying storage, which could be a local filesystem or a remote server.

    /**
     * DocumentManager maintains a list of currently 'open' Documents. It also owns the list of files in
     * the working set, and the notion of which Document is currently shown in the main editor UI area.
     *
     * Document is the model for a file's contents; it dispatches events whenever those contents change.
     * To transiently inspect a file's content, simply get a Document and call getText() on it. However,
     * to be notified of Document changes or to modify a Document, you MUST call addRef() to ensure the
     * Document instance 'stays alive' and is shared by all other who read/modify that file. ('Open'
     * Documents are all Documents that are 'kept alive', i.e. have ref count > 0).
     *
     * To get a Document, call getDocumentForPath(); never new up a Document yourself.
     *
     * Secretly, a Document may use an Editor instance to act as the model for its internal state. (This
     * is unavoidable because CodeMirror does not separate its model from its UI). Documents are not
     * modifiable until they have a backing 'master Editor'. Creation of the backing Editor is owned by
     * EditorManager. A Document only gets a backing Editor if it becomes the currentDocument, or if edits
     * occur in any Editor (inline or full-sized) bound to the Document; there is currently no other way
     * to ensure a Document is modifiable.
     *
     * A non-modifiable Document may still dispatch change notifications, if the Document was changed
     * externally on disk.
     *
     * Aside from the text content, Document tracks a few pieces of metadata - notably, whether there are
     * any unsaved changes.
     *
     * This module dispatches several events:
     *
     *    - dirtyFlagChange -- When any Document's isDirty flag changes. The 2nd arg to the listener is the
     *      Document whose flag changed.
     *    - documentSaved -- When a Document's changes have been saved. The 2nd arg to the listener is the
     *      Document that has been saved.
     *    - documentRefreshed -- When a Document's contents have been reloaded from disk. The 2nd arg to the
     *      listener is the Document that has been refreshed.
     *
     *    - currentDocumentChange -- When the value of getCurrentDocument() changes.
     *
     *    To listen for working set changes, you must listen to *all* of these events:
     *    - workingSetAdd -- When a file is added to the working set (see getWorkingSet()). The 2nd arg
     *      to the listener is the added File, and the 3rd arg is the index it was inserted at.
     *    - workingSetAddList -- When multiple files are added to the working set (e.g. project open, multiple file open).

     *      2nd arg to the listener is the removed File.
     *    - workingSetRemoveList -- When multiple files are removed from the working set (e.g. project close).
     *      The 2nd arg to the listener is the array of removed File objects.
     *    - workingSetSort -- When the workingSet array is reordered without additions or removals.
     *      Listener receives no arguments.
     *
     *    - workingSetDisableAutoSorting -- Dispatched in addition to workingSetSort when the reorder was caused
     *      by manual dragging and dropping. Listener receives no arguments.
     *
     *    - fileNameChange -- When the name of a file or folder has changed. The 2nd arg is the old name.

     *              to: end of change, expressed as {line: <line number>, ch: <chracter offset>},

     *
     *        The line and ch offsets are both 0-based.
     *
     *        The ch offset in "from" is inclusive, but the ch offset in "to" is exclusive. For example,
     *        an insertion of new content (without replacing existing content) is expressed by a range
     *        where from and to are the same.
     *

     *
     *        IMPORTANT: If you listen for the "change" event, you MUST also addRef() the document

    /**
     * Editor is a 1-to-1 wrapper for a CodeMirror editor instance. It layers on Brackets-specific
     * functionality and provides APIs that cleanly pass through the bits of CodeMirror that the rest
     * of our codebase may want to interact with. An Editor is always backed by a Document, and stays
     * in sync with its content; because Editor keeps the Document alive, it's important to always
     * destroy() an Editor that's going away so it can release its Document ref.
     *
     * For now, there's a distinction between the "master" Editor for a Document - which secretly acts
     * as the Document's internal model of the text state - and the multitude of "slave" secondary Editors
     * which, via Document, sync their changes to and from that master.
     *
     * For now, direct access to the underlying CodeMirror object is still possible via _codeMirror --
     * but this is considered deprecated and may go away.
     *
     * The Editor object dispatches the following events:
     *    - keyEvent -- When any key event happens in the editor (whether it changes the text or not).
     *          Event handlers are passed ({Editor}, {KeyboardEvent}). The 2nd arg is the raw DOM event.
     *          Note: most listeners will only want to respond when event.type === "keypress".
     *    - cursorActivity -- When the user moves the cursor or changes the selection, or an edit occurs.
     *          Note: do not listen to this in order to be generally informed of edits--listen to the
     *          "change" event on Document instead.
     *    - scroll -- When the editor is scrolled, either by user action or programmatically.
     *    - lostContent -- When the backing Document changes in such a way that this Editor is no longer
     *          able to display accurate text. This occurs if the Document's file is deleted, or in certain
     *          Document->editor syncing edge cases that we do not yet support (the latter cause will
     *          eventually go away).
     *    - optionChange -- Triggered when an option for the editor is changed. The 2nd arg to the listener
     *          is a string containing the editor option that is changing. The 3rd arg, which can be any
     *          data type, is the new value for the editor option.
     *
     * The Editor also dispatches "change" events internally, but you should listen for those on
     * Documents, not Editors.
     *
     * These are jQuery events, so to listen for them you do something like this:
     *    $(editorInstance).on("eventname", handler);
