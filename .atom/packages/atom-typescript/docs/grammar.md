# CSON grammar

Atom works with a CSON grammar. We generate this from Microsoft supported grammar files. This is the code https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/blob/master/scripts/grammar.js run using `npm run build` that updates our grammar file.

For grammar issues go here : https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-TmLanguage/issues and link back to us if you want us to pull from upstream :rose:.

# Dynamic Grammar

> Warning : :warning: This feature is now legacy but has some good learning

We used dynamic (code driven) grammar initially. Following are the lessons still worth sharing but we are using the CSON grammar now.

I am using `atom` and `first-mate` interchangeably here. There isn't a documented way of creating a grammar from *code*. We found a hacky way by reading a *lot of source code*. Please look at `typeScriptGrammar.ts`. Basically you inherit from `Grammar` and let that do the heavy lifting. Then all you need is to return `AtomTokens` from `tokenizeLine`. The way the atom grammar works is that they will store the returned `ruleSet` for any line and call `tokenizeLine` for the next line passing in that `ruleSet`. As soon as you edit a line all the following lines are invalidated and  `tokenizeLine` is called for them again. This works beautifully with the `ts.createClassifier` which is a quick syntactic classifier provided by the TS language service. It only depends on a `finalLexState` (e.g. did the previous line have a continuing multiline comment) and that is what we store in the `ruleSet`.

**Warnings**:
* Atom is stingy about you calling its `createToken` in the *right order* so don't just call it unless you have the classification at exactly the right time.
* Atom doesn't want you to classify the BOM. It will give it to you as a part of the string, its up to you to carefully ignore it and don't call `createToken` for it.
* Do not mutate the `ruleSet` that is passed into you. Its for the previous line. Create your own `ruleSet` for your line!
* Also see [#159](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/issues/159) to see how editor settings (still using regex copied from language-javascript) + forcefully tokenizing empty lines plays with autoindent.
